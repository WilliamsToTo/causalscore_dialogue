I am not an ambulance worker, I cannot help them either, but I can pray God can help them do their job. Then I let it go.",

So this is what I can do, I cannot fix the sick so the ambulance workers do their job, I do mine.

We would talk all the time, hang out together, and basically just do everything together. Because of Covid, I've had to stay in my house and basically not associate with anyone else. My friends don't even try to talk to me anymore. I understand that life goes on without me, but they could at least try.",

            "supporter: Why are you freaking out?",
            "seeker: I think that'll help, yeah",
            "supporter: Sometimes just a friend to hear you out and encourage you can really make a difference. Life has its ups and down.",
            "seeker: I decided to leave my husband, he keeps snapping at me and won't listen to me or let me do anything",
            "supporter: That's a difficult decision you have made.",
            "seeker: I'm worried how it'll go though because we have kids",
            "supporter: Have you tried to talk to him about the problem? Or a counselor?",
            "seeker: I've tried to talk to him about the control issues, but he doesn't listen. He doesn't know I'm planning to leave and I think he'll try to stop me",
            "supporter: I have worked at a domestic violence shelter before, the most dangerous time to leave a situation like this is when you leave.  Do you have a plan in place?",
            "seeker: I have some leads on apartments and some savings I'm putting aside, and a friend I plan on living with",
            "supporter: My husband used to be very controlling as well, I dragged him to counseling. He changed. He bucked at first, but eventually he went. We have gone a few times off and on over 20 years. We both came from broken homes.",
            "seeker: I haven't got 100% of the details worked out yet, but I'm trying",
            "supporter: Has he hurt you physically? or is he mainly emotionally abusive?",
            "seeker: He hasn't hurt me physically",
            "seeker: I often feel like he would but I'm also a child abuse survivor so it's hard to tell if that's true or just a memory",
            "supporter: I'm glad to hear that. I can understand that you would be really stressed at this time, however, I do encourage you to get a good plan in place, and definitely get counseling.",
            "seeker: I think that's the best idea",
            "supporter: Yes, I had child abuse in my life too, I really think counseling saved our marriage, 3 times. But like, I said, he didn't want to go. However, the first time, I did leave and stay with a friend, and that convinced him I was serious.",
            "seeker: that's a good thought, I wonder what he'd do if I stayed with a friend",
            "supporter: I wish I could fix this, but I can't. The road will be rocky and I don't know how I would have made it without people to encourage and support me, so I'm glad a friend is willing to have you stay with them until you can get on your feet.",
            "seeker: hey may not realize I'd leave at all",
            "seeker: me too, that's making all the difference",
            "supporter: My husband really loved me, but coming from a broken home, he lost his mom when he was 12, so he thought controlling me was the solution, very messed up, but he had to learn to see that.",
            "seeker: definitely that makes sense",
            "supporter: He feared I would die or leave him or something, but once he saw that, and realized what he was doing was hurting me and making me want to leave, he changed. But honestly, I have never understood men and why they dont' see life the way we do. Sometimes it takes that objective person to help them see it.",
            "seeker: I'm not convinced mine loves me, looking back it's beginning to seem like he was draining me for my income and labor",
            "supporter: Ouch! That sounds painful to look at.",
            "seeker: it is, I think I was super wrong about him and overlooked red flags",
            "supporter: People who truly love others become willing to change. Sometimes it takes a DRASTIC measure to wake them up, like leaving. He has not heard you, so many he will 'hear' it when you leave. But please be careful and have a plan.",
            "supporter: How long have you been married?",
            "seeker: eight years, together for 11",
            "supporter: That's a long time. I will say a prayer for your safety and for you to get some help, hopefully he will join you. Marriage is a lot of work, but it can't be one person, it has to be two.",
            "supporter: Don't leave anything in writing around until after you leave.",
            "seeker: absolutely!",
            "seeker: definitely no paper trail, for sure",
            "supporter: I believe in the power of prayer too. The Serenity prayer is a good one to help me let go of my fears and do what I can, leaving the rest to God.",
            "seeker: I know that one, it's helping me a lot too",
            "supporter: If I worry and get upset, then I waste energy, I have had to learn to get distracted if I find myself on that worry train, call a friend, go for a walk, just not obsess, it goes nowhere.",

The pandemic haulted a lot of that. I used to take rides and go out and enjoy nature or something simple by myself to rejuvinate but it's harder now being worried to be around people.

The CDC has not even one record of a healthy child dying. Can you still go to the park and let them run and play? I think it's healthier to be around people then to isolate.

For example. I realized I didn't speak respectfully to him all the time.  So I changed my tone. Sometimes I didn't FEEL respectful, but I read this book explaining how men really need that. So I changed me. And you know what, he really responded well to that. Became more kind and loving. I prayed a lot and that is one thing God showed me. I read a few books on what men were like and how I could help my marriage. My husband often oblivious, but when I worked on me and doing things that men like, he actually became a better man. Hard to explain.",

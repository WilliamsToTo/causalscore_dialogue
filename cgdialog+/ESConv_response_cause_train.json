There are also black males who have been robbed and jumped by white people that does not mean all white males are bad. It does seem that you have had alot of unfortunate events with black males. That still does not mean that all black people are bad and why should innocent people pay for things others have done. Do\n you have to walk home from work or can you drive. Also have you reported any of these events to the police.",

The epicness of God bringing Moses and his people out of Egypt through walls of water, marching around Jericho to make a city crumble, oh and how did I almost forget the flood. Like literally God being so frustrated with humanity being like little children who won't obey the rules so he's like you're all done--but then God creates Noah because He knows all this will take place and Noah and his family become redeemers for the entire planet. The miracles and wonders of God put me in awe when I read them. "

He had went and got some that morning and he would always give them to me so I could give them to him so he didn't take them all.  I was so upset that he went and got them.  He was packing up his truck with things to take to the new shop that day.  He was a tattoo artist and just started a new job.  I didn't even get out of bed to help him and he knew I was upset with him.",

But he didn't have the best relationship with any of them.  They couldn't accept him for who he was.  His biological father didn't have anything to do with him.  His mom was remarried and had two more kids and they didn't treat my boyfriend very good growing up.  He ended up living with his grandparents.  He finally had acceptance in my family.

            "seeker: His mood swings are affecting his ability to stay employed and keep friends and family from wanting to interact with him.",

            "supporter: Is your friend mark behavior affecting you?",
            "seeker: I suspect he's not taking his medication as prescribed.  He's become a sociopath, which I understand is common with people suffering from this disorder.  He's unable to be empathic or sympathetic to anyone else's life.",
            "supporter: To confirm your friend mark, you suspect he is not taking his medicine and that is why he is acting the way he is?",
            "seeker: Yes, it is affecting me.  In sum, I'm the only one left in his corner, but I feel like he's slipping away and becoming completely dysfunctional.  It's tough with privacy laws for me to even talk to his doctor to see what's going on.  I did send his doctor a long email, however, so hopefully he'll make whatever adjustments need to be made.",
            "seeker: That's my suspicion, because things seem to be getting worse, quite honestly.",
            "supporter: Have you talked to mark about his behavior and how it is affecting everyone around him?",
            "supporter: I can understand how you feeling and that you are trying to help your friend. you are a very good friend for doing that.",
            "seeker: I have talked to him repeatedly.  Each time, he assures me that he understands my concerns and that he's going to get things together.  Literally, within a day or two, I hear from a mutual friend or family member that he's reverted back to doing things that are sociopathic.",
            "supporter: Have you asked him about him taking his medication?",
            "seeker: I have.  He tells me that he's taking it regularly (or most of the time).  I challenged him on it and told him it can't be 'most of the time.'  That's why I sent his doctor a long email, explaining things to him, to see if he can't intervene and try to straighten him out.",
            "supporter: ok. dealing with someone with bi-polar disorder can be really tough and challenging but it is not there fault that they are acting the way they are. They just honestly can not help it. I know you are doing everything you can to help him and to stop him from acting that way.",

            "seeker: Thank you.  I think you understand the sadness and anxiety in feeling powerless in this situation (or mostly powerless).  I have no real expertise in this area, but by contacting his doctor, maybe he can reevaluate whether the medicine and dosage needs to be changed.",
            "seeker: Funny you ask.  He's a grown man - 35-years old.  I've never known him to have this issue, which seems so strange to me.",
            "supporter: I understand a lot.",
            "seeker: It started about 14 months ago - at least that's when people started alerting me to strange behavior.  I thought people who were bi-polar contracted the illness earlier in their life.",
            "supporter: How long have you known about his bi polar diorder?",
            "seeker: Around 10 months ago is when I first found out.  Since then, I've received about 5 phone calls from people expressing concern.  I've visited him 3 times.",

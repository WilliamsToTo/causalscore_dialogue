            "speaker1: It was pretty tasty! My dog sure was popular, lol.  I love their blonde roast but went for a caramel macchiatto today",
            "speaker2: I see.  I love the caramel macchiatto.  Do you have a way to make coffee when you are doing events outdoors?",
            "speaker1: I have a little camp coffee pot, just pour boiling water from the fire over the grounds. It's quite wonderful at sunrise.  Have you ever been able to take your kids camping?",
            "speaker2: Yes.  Well, we have a camper so it's not 'roughing it'.  But we do like getting out in nature.  They love it.  And, to me, nothing is better than watching the sunrise with a cup of coffee in your hand.",
            "speaker1: Oh I bet having a camper is so nice! It's one of our savings goals. I do love the idea of having a toilet and shower easily accessible!",
            "speaker2: It is wonderful.  And it allows us to stay longer than we would in a tent.  I especially love it because, at night, we pull the screen and projector out and watch movies outside with some popcorn.  As my friend says, its more like 'glamping'.",
            "speaker1: That actually sounds wonderful. I do love camping but I'm getting older and sleeping on the ground is starting to be a little ridiculous. Glamping through my 40s would probably save my back",
            "speaker2: I am sure.  but with your running and outdoor lifestyle I am sure you are still in great shape?",
            "speaker1: I do my best to keep in shape, not perfect but I do try. I like to think the outdoors has kept me young!",
            "speaker2: I can only imagine.  Having a camper would definitely give your body ample rest during all your outdoor activities.  I love to run also.  But it is nice to have a comfortable bed to sleep in afterward.",
            "speaker1: I heard from a friend a couple of days ago that they were planning on selling their camper, and I thought you might be interested in buying it off from them. I can give you their cell, so you can give them a call and negotiate the price.",
            "speaker2: I might be! Do you happene to have any more information about it right now? Hey, maybe then I could sell you mine and we could be glamping buddies! It would certainly be better for your back and I would have an adult to talk to instead of just the kids.",
            "speaker1: I will try to get some photos of it and send it to you! I'd definitely be open to taking a look at your camper, I really need to get off the ground when I am sleeping before my back can never be fixed.",
            "speaker2: Sounds great, I really think I am ready for more space. More space means a bigger TV for movie night! Is running not helping as much as you'd like? My one neighbor does yoga and says that helps with her back a ton!",
            "speaker1: No running is not helping, but I want to keep with it. I will look into Yoga, do you have any recommendations on getting started?",
            "speaker2: Maybe I should get into running. How often do you go? I'll ask my neighbor. That way you can ask yours about the RV and I can ask mine about yoga and we can compare notes over coffee!",
            "speaker1: That sounds great! I try to run every morning, but there are some mornings I just can't get out of bed. Do you and your family like to go hiking?",
            "speaker2: Every day?! I was thinking about starting out twice a week but now that feels wimpy ha. The kids always drag me out for a hike or two when we go 'glamping'. I always complain and say that makes it too much like actual camping.",
            "speaker1: It is better to start slow so that you don",
            "speaker2: That's true, I don't want to over-exert myself, I'm no spring chicken! I really hope you this camper upgrade works out and you do buy mine! I'm sure your pooch would love it so much. And the sunrises are to die for. And that way YOU can hike with the kids and I get to take my time setting up the movies!",
            "speaker1: Sorry about that, you don't want to scare yourself away from running by doing too much at first. But yes, we really should get together once you have talked to your neighbor and I have talked to mine. We can start planning some trips!",
            "speaker2: Any idea where you'd like to go first? There are a lot of great local state parks. Or, if you're feeling adventurous, you could join us on one of our National Park trips! We're working our way through all of them!",

            "speaker2: I have never owned or bought a camper before, but I think 5 grand is a decent price. You can start off with this one and upgrade to a better one the next time.",
            "speaker1: Yes that is what I was thinking. Given my back pains, I think this will allow us to continue camping but enjoy something a little more comfortable than the ground. Do you have any other recommendation for dealing with back pain while camping?",
            "speaker2: My husband used to very bad back pain when we go camping. I was fine with sleeping on a yoga pad in our tent but he was not. So we bought a high quality air mattress to sleep at night in the tent and he is perfectly happy with that now. Maybe you can try that. Where are you planning to go next?",
            "speaker1: Thanks for the tip. I might purchase one of those. I think it will definitely help. We are thinking of heading up to the Northern National Park next month. Are you going to camping any time soon?",

Well I hope you can find a teaching position, we need all the best teachers we can get.  Are you done with school?",

I'm headed into the social science right now.  Studying people and the way we interact with one another and the environment around us.",

            "speaker1: I usually get the double burger with lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, ketchup, mayo and mustard. Plus a small fry I can usually share that with my kids and we all have enough fries.",

            "speaker2: Yeah, with all the fast food I love to eat, I've thought about it too. I know some of my friends do it instead of Uber because they don't have to deal with people then. Have you ever had a bad experience with people Ubering?",

            "speaker2: Very much so, all dairy in general! But it does get easier after you figure out what good substitutes you can enjoy.  I feel lucky that there are so many choices out there now.  Do you have any trips coming up this summer?",

            "speaker1: Oh yeah. The last time I visited we rented a 4 wheel drive and it was worth it. We were climbing the mountains to reach our chalet. It was so wild heading up the side of a mountain, looking over the side. Yikes! When I was there we didn't head to Dollywood, but we were close to it. Where in the mountains do you hike when you do?",
            "speaker2: That sounds like a perfect time for you.  When I'm hiking, the steeper the mountain, the better!! I like to take day trips where I know I'll be out for about 8 hours or so.  They are very tough to do, but if you're prepared it becomes a very rewarding experience!!",

I don't know how I'd handle seeing a bear or something like that out by myself.",

Or an individual one?",
            "speaker2: Its just an individual tent that is VERY small.  I just bring a backpack so everything has to be as small as possible. Luckily I have not had to use it yet!!  Do you paint when you're in the mountains too?",
            "speaker1: My friend told me she's having another house party. Do you have any ideas for vegan dishes I could bring?",
            "speaker2: Depending on what kind of party it is, if it's a buffet then there are some great vegan sausage rolls in the supermarkets now, and also vegan pizzas and burgers. If it's a bit more of a sit down dinner, vegan curries are so easy to make. I made one last week with sweet potatoes, red pepper, chickpeas, onion and garlic. It can be served with rice or other grains.",
            "speaker1: That sounds amazing. I am just starting on this vegan journey. Do you have any suggestions for cook books?",

I was also going to say to you that there's a cheese shop nearby that has started doing loads of vegan cheeses... here come the cheese and wine nights!",

            "speaker2: My favorite has to be a version of a vegan pizza.  That is the food I miss the most!! Are you vegan too?",
            "speaker1: No, but my best friend is trying to become one. She is a vegetarian, but being a vegan can be so hard when you love cheese. Lol I always make a delicious roasted veggie dish to bring to her house for parties. Do you find cutting out cheese a challenge too?",
            "speaker2: Very much so, all dairy in general! But it does get easier after you figure out what good substitutes you can enjoy.  I feel lucky that there are so many choices out there now.  Do you have any trips coming up this summer?",
            "speaker1: I hope to travel to the smokey mountains soon. It is one of my favorite places on Earth. Have you ever been there? It's so peaceful and being up so high just surrounded by trees is magical!",
            "speaker2: I went there when I was very young actually! My only memories are of dollywood and the long, winding roads!! I'm sure now going as an adult I would have a much more rich experience.  That would be a great place to bring the Jeep now that I think of it!",
            "speaker1: Oh yeah. The last time I visited we rented a 4 wheel drive and it was worth it. We were climbing the mountains to reach our chalet. It was so wild heading up the side of a mountain, looking over the side. Yikes! When I was there we didn't head to Dollywood, but we were close to it. Where in the mountains do you hike when you do?",
            "speaker2: That sounds like a perfect time for you.  When I'm hiking, the steeper the mountain, the better!! I like to take day trips where I know I'll be out for about 8 hours or so.  They are very tough to do, but if you're prepared it becomes a very rewarding experience!!",
            "speaker1: Wow. That sounds like an amazing day trip for sure. I'm not sure I have the stamina for such an intense hiking experience. Have you ever ran into any trouble while hiking?",
            "speaker2: There was one time where I got lost as it was starting to get dark out...I bring my tent and supplies to sleep overnight so I was prepared to sleep out there if I had to but luckily I ran into a couple just about when I was ready to give up!! I don't know how I'd handle seeing a bear or something like that out by myself.",
            "speaker1: I'm so glad you didn't cross paths with anything scary like that! I don't know what I'd do if a bear crossed my path either. I've been pretty lucky to never have one near our cabin in the Mountains either. They always warn us about them though, so we are prepared. Do you have a pretty big tent you use? Or an individual one?",
            "speaker2: Its just an individual tent that is VERY small.  I just bring a backpack so everything has to be as small as possible. Luckily I have not had to use it yet!!  Do you paint when you're in the mountains too?",
            "speaker1: My friend told me she's having another house party. Do you have any ideas for vegan dishes I could bring?",
            "speaker2: Depending on what kind of party it is, if it's a buffet then there are some great vegan sausage rolls in the supermarkets now, and also vegan pizzas and burgers. If it's a bit more of a sit down dinner, vegan curries are so easy to make. I made one last week with sweet potatoes, red pepper, chickpeas, onion and garlic. It can be served with rice or other grains.",
            "speaker1: That sounds amazing. I am just starting on this vegan journey. Do you have any suggestions for cook books?",
            "speaker2: There's a book called 'The Plant Kitchen' which is quite good but I can't remember where I got it. You can borrow it if you like! I was also going to say to you that there's a cheese shop nearby that has started doing loads of vegan cheeses... here come the cheese and wine nights!",
            "speaker1: Really? I would love to borrow it. I've spent time at the market looking around and even the farmers market. It just seems so overhwelming at the moment but I know the long term benefits far outweigh my confusing right now.",
            "speaker2: When I first went vegetarian (before I thought about going vegan), I realised the best way to do it was eat what you would normally, but just miss out the meat. For example, if you're getting Chinese food, have whatever you usually have (my fave is sweet and sour), but just get the veggie version. Gradually I realised that I wasn't missing the meat at all as I was still eating my favourite dishes. What's your favorite food?",
            "speaker1: So like with Chinese food I can still order my favorite...beef and brocoli but without the meat. What about tofu? Do you eat that?",
            "speaker2: Haha yes in that case you might need to find a replacement for the beef. Tofu would be a good substitute but it's got a very different texture. I do eat tofu sometimes, I chop up a block of it into cubes and oven bake it, or I marinade it in BBQ flavourings and fry it on the pan. It's great with all sorts of things.",

            "speaker2: Tofu can be rubbery if you don't make it crispy. But if it's fried properly it's so delicious; crisp on the outside and softer on the inside. I get protein from peanut butter, brown rice, quinoa, beans, oats for breakfast and loads of veggies. I've always loved vegetables though, so it was quite easy for me to convert! What's your favorite vegetable?",
            "speaker1: You know, I never even thought about frying it. I'm heading to Trader Joes later today so hopefully I will be able to have more choices. I never thought of vegetables as a protein source. I love all veggies.",

            "speaker1: I learned a lot of Spanish, believe it or not, when I lived in Texas! Since its so close to the border you easily can pick up on it.  Although I do want to go to Italy this summer and thought it would be fun to learn a little before I do that.  Do you have any vacations coming up?",

We are looking into getting a cat though, they seem a little bit easier to take care of! Sounds like they don't want you around most of the day anyhow, haha! Have you ever had a cat?",

You can make a lot of money in the middle ground with selling them for a higher price. Its kind of like flipping a home and making a profit. Are you interested in that job too?",

            "speaker1: They are a wig manufacturer and they said they'd give me $300 for a pound of my hair.  I don't think I'd want to cut off that much of it though, even though I don't like it.  I've basically been working as a dog/walker, florist delivery/ all kinds of odd jobs. I'd rather work from home as much as possible.",

If you have to travel, can they come with or do you have someone to look in on them? Do you want a quiet pet? Do you want a pet to play with? etc., etc. There's a lot to think about. I got my girl because she's easy to travel with and very friendly.",

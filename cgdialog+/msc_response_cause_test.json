            "speaker1: Yes, I'm hoping it's a 'mutual love at first sight' situation.  But I'm also trying to be thoughtful about this, and if I do end up bringing one home, I want to make sure I have everything they need to be comfortable.  I guess cats are supposed to like verticality, with the ability to climb and hang around off the ground and that type of thing.  I need to do some research and planning beyond just finding a cat.  I suppose that's the accountant in me coming out.",
            "speaker2: That's really intelligent and mature though, to make sure that you can meet all of the needs of the cat before bringing it into your home. They do love the vertical trees, lots of cat toys and playing with them, and making sure they have a secure place they can go to hide. They need a comfortable place to decompress when they are upset",
            "speaker1: If you get another cat are you worried about how it might get along with Lucky?  And is there anything you can do to facilitate them getting along better, especially Lucky accepting them coming into Lucky's space?",
            "speaker2: Yes that is somewhat of a concern, but not too much because Lucky really likes to be around other cats. I would make sure they each have their own space and introduce them in a neutral territory. I got lucky fixed early on so I am not too concerned about him becoming territorial",
            "speaker1: That's good.  How does Lucky handle being at home alone?  That's something else I'm a little concerned about since the house will regularly be empty except for the cat.  Especially at first I'd be concerned about how they might deal with that, although perhaps that would ease them into the new environment to some degree.",
            "speaker2: Cats spend like 18 hours sleeping every day and they are pretty independent so they don't mind too much being alone, but only if their other needs are being met, like a good feeding schedule and you personally playing with the cat so you can bond. That goes a long way",
            "speaker1: Hahaha!  18 hours of sleeping.  That sounds like the life!  But that's good advice.  Yes, if I'm going to bring a cat into my life I want to make sure to provide for all their needs and keep them happy.  I suppose that to some degree it would let me know if some need is being unmet by some unwelcome behavior.  It's a lot to think about and consider but if I'm going to do it I'd like to do it right.",

            "speaker1: Yeah maybe you are right. I am in a bit of a shock right now and I do not think clearly. I am so worried about her. She is the only one. That's why I am so worried. I really care for her",

            "speaker2: Hello, I'm doing well, I can pilot a plane!",
            "speaker1: Wow, I only work in a factory. Wheres your favorite city to fly to?",
            "speaker2: That is cool, I don't fly far because I live in up in the mountains.",
            "speaker1: Oh, if I could fly I'd fly to seattle my favorite city",
            "speaker2: That would be nice, I use flying to feed my hobby which is photography.",
            "speaker1: How fun! You like jazz music?? I love it",
            "speaker2: I do! I listen to the radio because I don't have a television.",
            "speaker1: Wow!! I do not have a car and ride my bike everywhere, but I do have a tv",
            "speaker2: That is cool. Well I have to get off here soon. Is there anything else?",
            "speaker1: Me too. I did break my nose when I was 10 from a bike accident, but yeah",
            "speaker2: That's crazy hope you okay now!",
            "speaker1: Yeah, I get practise riding everywhere now",
            "speaker2: That's nice I fell on a fire place and broke my nose when I was 4",
            "speaker1: I just got switched to the night shift at my job and I'm a little worried about riding my bike in the dark.",
            "speaker2: Oh no, I definitely understand that. It's a little dangerous to ride a bike in the dark and I'm sure having already had a bike accident makes you even more nervous. Do you have reflective gear you can wear to be a little safer?",
            "speaker1: Heh nice that you understand me, I have a helmet but nothing to save my nose, you know what I mean lol. Most likely I need to stop listening jazz while riding as it might be dangerous. What a shame",
            "speaker2: Lol I definitely know what you mean! Maybe you could get one of those reflective vests that runners wear. It would at least help cars see you better. Definitely a shame to have to stop listening to jazz when riding. I'm sure that helps pass the time so much faster!",
            "speaker1: Yes I will buy reflective vest. Most likely I will need to find new job here. for few years I really fell love in Seattle. Have you been in Seattle before? I mean properly not just in airport or hotel for one night",
            "speaker2: Oh I agree, I'm partial to the mountains, but really do enjoy Seattle. I've had a few layovers there and gotten to explore the city. It's beautiful (when it isn't raining lol)!",
            "speaker1: Heh, and how is in your place up there? Isn't it cold or foggy? I can bet nice views there to take photos. I feel jealous now hehe",
            "speaker2: Hehe you'll have to come visit sometime! The views are amazing and it's foggy in the mornings sometimes, but in the evenings the sunsets are amazing and you can see for miles. I've taken a ton of photos of the sunsets and even have them hanging in my house! Have you been to the mountains? hehe",
            "speaker1: I would like someday to visit your place. That's why I am not wondering why you don't own a TV. I was in Swiss mountains about 15 years ago and it was just amazing.",
            "speaker2: I'm glad you understand that, some people find it odd that I don't own a TV, but I feel that I enjoy the area a lot more without the distraction of a tv. I would love to go to the Swiss mountains! They are beautiful! I'm not really into skiing, but have always wanted to ski there just to say that I have. You know? Plus I'd love to get some of their chocolate. Did you try any when you were there?",
            "speaker1: You should definitely visit Swiss, as for me chocolate was alright nothing special. Also if I can save enough money maybe we could have a fly tour for a few days and visiting few places? I would be so happy",
            "speaker2: Oh I love that idea! I get employee benefits from the airline, so could get us some great discounts on flights! What are the top places you'd like to see?",
            "speaker1: I could be getting ready to ride my bike in the dark. I live in Seattle so it could of started raining.",
            "speaker2: I have been to Seattle once, what area of the city are you based in ?",

            "speaker2: Its great that its a nice area. Occasionally I get a layover in a city between flights and Seattle is somewhere I'd like to explore further. Are there any sights you would recommend me checking out next time i'm in the area ?",
            "speaker1: Aside from the obvious like the Space Needle? It'd really depend on what you're interested in and want to see. This cities got a little bit for everyone.",
            "speaker2: I love Museums and Art Galleries and botanical gardens etc. I've recently had a few days in Washington and got time to visit the Smithsonian museum and Arlington Cemetery. They were both so interesting and I'd highly recommend them. Have you ever been to Washington ?",
            "speaker1: I'd love to, but I haven't really been able travel. I'm a pretty big history buff so I'd love to visit some of the historical locations in the Washington area.",
            "speaker2: There are so many !! You'd have a great time and In Washington there are so many museums covering so many different topics that I'm sure you'd find something of interest. They probably have a Jazz museum somewhere too !! Are there any good Bars or clubs in Seattle to listen to Jazz Music in ?",
            "speaker1: Seattle has a great club scene, I hear there's a popular one that specializes in Jazz but I haven't been to it myself. Maybe if you visit the city we can get together and both check it out?",

            "speaker1: I have heard the same about possibly stiffing up more spirits.  I would strongly think about it though.  My aunt had a situation in her home about 5 years ago and used a psychic medium who was able to help communicate with the spirit and eventually the spirit was able to make peace and left the home.  I can get you the contact info if you are interested.",

They have not noticed anything either.  I suspect that not all spirits are harmful though.  My grandmother is ill and will probably not make it.  I would love it if she visited once she goes to the other side.",

My aunt had a situation in her home about 5 years ago and used a psychic medium who was able to help communicate with the spirit and eventually the spirit was able to make peace and left the home.  I can get you the contact info if you are interested.",

She's doing really well and I'm very proud of her for going back to school because I know it wasn't an easy decision.  Hey maybe she should join us on our ski trip in case I don't learn as quickly as I think I will, haha!!",

            "speaker2: Very nice. That's definitely a must-do activity. What film did you see? I recommend the Giant Lotus Bar if you're passing by the area. Their food is surprisingly cheap and the staff are all so lovely. It's Italian-inspired, which your favourite I believe.",
            "speaker1: I went to see a The Lady and the Tramp and When Harry met Sally, it was a double feature matinee.  I do love Italian food and it would be great to get a New York slice.  Do they serve pizza?",

            "speaker2: I'm sorry to hear that. But they definitely have cheese pizza! And they'll accommodate you with a big glass of water; they're great like that! I do like pizza, and one of my favourite toppings is pineapple. What do you think of pineapple on pizza? I know a lot of people think it's awful!",
            "speaker1: I actually love pineapple on pizza, something unique about the sweet flavor in combination with the cheese oils just hits the spot.  The consistency of it is not to thick or firm so it's not overbearing against the texture of the bread and cheese which are quite soft.  Not to overpowering on flavor which is why like strawberry makes no sense, but pineapple is perfect.",

            "speaker1: We aren't very religious. But those all sound like great things for kids to grow up learning. When did you find this faith?",

Nothing really spoke to me so I decided to just establish my own. It doesn't make sense to a lot of people, but it works for me. How are you feeling? When areyou due?",

            "speaker1: How did you end up with 4 dogs who are all siblings?",

            "speaker2: Lol I definitely know what you mean! Maybe you could get one of those reflective vests that runners wear. It would at least help cars see you better. Definitely a shame to have to stop listening to jazz when riding. I'm sure that helps pass the time so much faster!",
            "speaker1: Yes I will buy reflective vest. Most likely I will need to find new job here. for few years I really fell love in Seattle. Have you been in Seattle before? I mean properly not just in airport or hotel for one night",
            "speaker2: Oh I agree, I'm partial to the mountains, but really do enjoy Seattle. I've had a few layovers there and gotten to explore the city. It's beautiful (when it isn't raining lol)!",
            "speaker1: Heh, and how is in your place up there? Isn't it cold or foggy? I can bet nice views there to take photos. I feel jealous now hehe",
            "speaker2: Hehe you'll have to come visit sometime! The views are amazing and it's foggy in the mornings sometimes, but in the evenings the sunsets are amazing and you can see for miles. I've taken a ton of photos of the sunsets and even have them hanging in my house! Have you been to the mountains? hehe",
            "speaker1: I would like someday to visit your place. That's why I am not wondering why you don't own a TV. I was in Swiss mountains about 15 years ago and it was just amazing.",
            "speaker2: I'm glad you understand that, some people find it odd that I don't own a TV, but I feel that I enjoy the area a lot more without the distraction of a tv. I would love to go to the Swiss mountains! They are beautiful! I'm not really into skiing, but have always wanted to ski there just to say that I have. You know? Plus I'd love to get some of their chocolate. Did you try any when you were there?",
            "speaker1: You should definitely visit Swiss, as for me chocolate was alright nothing special. Also if I can save enough money maybe we could have a fly tour for a few days and visiting few places? I would be so happy",
            "speaker2: Oh I love that idea! I get employee benefits from the airline, so could get us some great discounts on flights! What are the top places you'd like to see?",

            "speaker2: Its great that its a nice area. Occasionally I get a layover in a city between flights and Seattle is somewhere I'd like to explore further. Are there any sights you would recommend me checking out next time i'm in the area ?",
            "speaker1: Aside from the obvious like the Space Needle? It'd really depend on what you're interested in and want to see. This cities got a little bit for everyone.",
            "speaker2: I love Museums and Art Galleries and botanical gardens etc. I've recently had a few days in Washington and got time to visit the Smithsonian museum and Arlington Cemetery. They were both so interesting and I'd highly recommend them. Have you ever been to Washington ?",
            "speaker1: I'd love to, but I haven't really been able travel. I'm a pretty big history buff so I'd love to visit some of the historical locations in the Washington area.",
            "speaker2: There are so many !! You'd have a great time and In Washington there are so many museums covering so many different topics that I'm sure you'd find something of interest. They probably have a Jazz museum somewhere too !! Are there any good Bars or clubs in Seattle to listen to Jazz Music in ?",
            "speaker1: Seattle has a great club scene, I hear there's a popular one that specializes in Jazz but I haven't been to it myself. Maybe if you visit the city we can get together and both check it out?",

            "speaker1: I've gone skiing many times with my wife, but we were thinking about taking our 12 and 14 year old sons skiing for their first time. They love all sports, and they like excitement, so I think they will love it.",
            "speaker2: That's awesome! It is such a rush. When will your wife be finished her nursing training?",
            "speaker1: She only has 1 more year to go to get her nursing degree and license. I'm excited that both of us will be working in the medical field. She'll be making a lot more money once she starts working as a nurse, and this will help a lot. So, are you well prepared for the ski competition, Tami?",
            "speaker2: I will be soon. I'm going to a physiotherapy appointment this week to prepare. I'll also get a massage later on to really loosen up. Do you work full time?",
            "speaker1: Good. I hope you win! Yes, I'm working full-time as a physical therapist and driving for Uber on the side to make ends meet, so I'm very busy.",
            "speaker2: That's fantastic. Plus the pets must keep your family occupied on top of that, too. Do you get any wild weather down in Texas while out on the road with your Uber gig?",
            "speaker1: It hasn't been windy lately, thankfully. It's definitely not cold and snow-covered like it is by you.",
            "speaker2: That's good to hear. But I imagine it gets quite hot at times. A coworker told me an anecdote about how he fell asleep by the pool on vacation in Texas and woke up with an insane sunburn.",
            "speaker1: Yeah, you can definitely burn really easily here. I would like to go skiing sometime, maybe in California.",

            "speaker2: Yes, I still go to PT for it, but they cleared me last week! Thill will be my first competition since the accident.",
            "speaker1: That's wonderful news I know you'll do great and I can't wait to hear all about it.  Would love to have you come visit us in TX once the season is over.  The boys' football games are getting really instense now that they're getting older and I know you'll get a kick out of it.",
            "speaker2: That sounds like a good vacation! My mind is on skiing so much, I pretty much have to go somewhere flat to get my mind off of it. I'd love to see them play too.",

Thankfully I didn't get hurt and neither did anyone else.",

It was a crazy night had to fill out a lot of paperwork, stupid neighbor always thought he was dumb.",

            "speaker1: I have tried Spanish seafood paella and seafood spaghetti, but not success. I think you are right, maybe I used defrosted shrimp.",

My aunt had a situation in her home about 5 years ago and used a psychic medium who was able to help communicate with the spirit and eventually the spirit was able to make peace and left the home.  I can get you the contact info if you are interested.",

            "speaker2: Just prepping my 4 german shepherds to take their shift watching out for ghosts!",
            "speaker1: That sounds fun. Unfortunately, I've an injury, on top of carrying twins.",
            "speaker2: That is too bad, I started my own religion, maybe it could help you?",
            "speaker1: I could use all the prayers I can get, this will make 5 children for me",
            "speaker2: Wow, that is a lot. Think they could all fit in a convertible? I only buy those.",
            "speaker1: They could. Count me out, I vomit every morning because of the twins I'm carrying",
            "speaker2: Wow. Vomit is gross, especially from ghosts! I have seen that happen a few times, ghosts vomiting!",
            "speaker1: The doctor has me assigned to bed rest for almost half a year. Come visit me?",
            "speaker2: You mind if I bring the four dogs? They love convertible rides.",
            "speaker1: Sure! My 3 kids are very good around animals.",
            "speaker2: Awesome, hopefully I get there before there's 5 so each one gets a dog!",
            "speaker1: What a great idea! Just don't bring any ghosts around.",
            "speaker2: I will try not to, but they seem to like me. That's why the dogs are on watch!",
            "speaker1: Do you have any personal home remedies for morning pregnancy sickness?",
            "speaker2: I usually just pray to the convertible gods of my church, then go for a ride!",
            "speaker1: My twins have been kicking.",
            "speaker2: That's really good. It must be so exciting right? You already have three children right?",
            "speaker1: Yes, two girls and one boy as of right now. I am hoping for two more boys.",
            "speaker2: That's amazing. Well, I hope you get what you wish for. How old are your three children? Isn't it already too hard with three kids? Are you nervous to have five kids? I am actually very nervous to have kids, and that's why I just don't want kids. Instead, I have 4 German shepherds to keep me busy.",
            "speaker1: The girls are eleven and  five, the boy is eight. It's not too hard now since they are able to help around the house. I was nervous at first about how my other three would take it, but they are all very excited! Four German Shepards have to be a handful too. Do you walk them all at once or one at a time?",
            "speaker2: That's good. I mean, eventually as the kids get older they're more handy. With the dogs, yes they can get handful, but I kind of manage with them. I do take them for a walk two at a time as it makes it more easier, but sometimes it does get overwhelming. Also, I do like taking them for a drive in my convertible. They really enjoy a drive in the car.",
            "speaker1: That must be amazing to see, four big dogs enjoying the ride. How old are all of them? Did you get them all at once or got a new one every so often?",
            "speaker2: I got them all at once. They're siblings actually. So, they're all like 3 years old now. They're mother died while giving birth, and so all of them were kept together to overcome the loss. When I went to purchase them, I saw them all together, and didn't want to separate them as they all looked really traumatized. That's why I purchased them all at once. Do you have any dogs? .",

            "speaker2: Did you find anything you liked?",
            "speaker1: A few things, but we are going to look at another dealership before we decide. Tell me more about your religion? Should I convert?",
            "speaker2: I can't really say whether you should convert or not, that's something that you really need to decide for yourself. I can tell you that my my religion is different from most others in that there aren't a bunch of restrictions and rules. The main thing is to just be a good person. Karma is also a huge thing I believe in. How would you're husband feel about you converting? And what about the kids?",
            "speaker1: We aren't very religious. But those all sound like great things for kids to grow up learning. When did you find this faith?",
            "speaker2: It's been about 5 years, I had a falling out at my previous religious institution (would rather not talk about that...), and I went on an exploration of religion. Nothing really spoke to me so I decided to just establish my own. It doesn't make sense to a lot of people, but it works for me. How are you feeling? When areyou due?",
            "speaker1: I'm at 6 months. Honestly its easier now that this is my fourth time. We are still deciding on names though. How did your parents choose your name?",
            "speaker2: I honestly don't know! I've never though to ask them. I'll have to d that some time. Do you know what you're having?",
            "speaker1: two more boys! I have thought about giving them 'matching names', but then I also want them to feel like they are more than twins, and i am afraid if i give them names that go together they will always feel like 1/2 a set instead of a complete person on their own.",
            "speaker2: I never even thought about it like that! That makes sense though. Tough decision. How are the other kids feeling about the new edition? Are they excited?",
            "speaker1: My son is very excited to have brothers. I think the girls are less happy that they are going to be out-numbered soon. Have you thought about having kids?",
            "speaker2: I've thought about it, but just don't know if it's right for me. I like my independence (and my convertible!) I just can't imagine giving up so much and being tied down. Maybe later in life. Did you always know you wanted a family?",
            "speaker1: How did you end up with 4 dogs who are all siblings?",
            "speaker2: My dogs are my family, and I would never want to separate a family, be it humans or fuzzy little critters. You sound like you have a litter of your own at home, though. LOL.",
            "speaker1: That's cool, did you have the parent dogs as well?",

She'll be making a lot more money once she starts working as a nurse, and this will help a lot. So, are you well prepared for the ski competition, Tami?",

The consistency of it is not to thick or firm so it's not overbearing against the texture of the bread and cheese which are quite soft.  Not to overpowering on flavor which is why like strawberry makes no sense, but pineapple is perfect.",

            "speaker2: Hopefully in the next couple weeks I'll be able to start training and practicing again. My coach doesn't want me to rush it.",
            "speaker1: That is really great news. Your coach is probably right though, you should take it slowly. Is someone walking your dog while you recover?",
            "speaker2: Yes, while I'm in therapy, my parents drop by to take care of her. What kind of puppies do you have?",
            "speaker1: At least that is one less worry for you! I have Yorkshire Terrier puppies. They are so cute! They will stay quite small too. What dog do you have?",
            "speaker2: I have an Australian Shepherd, Luna. She's full of energy. Do you plan to keep all of the puppies or do you sell them?",
            "speaker1: How old is Luna? She sounds like she is a lot of fun! My heart wants to keep them but I feel like they may be too much work so my mind is telling me to sell 3 of them. What do you think?",
            "speaker2: Luna is 3 years old and is very smart since she's a working breed. Four would be a handful, maybe sell 2 and keep 2 so they don't get completely separated.",

            "speaker2: It's still quite sore, but it's slowly getting better.  Thanks for asking!  I'm hoping it heals up enough that I'll get able to get back out on walks with my dog soon!  We both miss it!  How are your dogs doing?",
            "speaker1: Im sure she's ready to back out there! I kept the two girls from the litter, I named them lily and grace!",

            "speaker2: Gotcha, that makes sense!  That sounds like a lot of fun!  I always wanted to get into photography myself, but the fancy cameras with all the settings are intimidating to me!  How long have you been doing it?",
            "speaker1: I've been doing it since I got married, so I would say about 3 years now. It was confusing for me when I started, but if you spend time just reading instruction manuals and looking at free advice for setting, you'd totally catch on!",
            "speaker2: I've watched a couple YouTube videos on it, it's amazing the helpful things people will take the time to upload on there.  I guess I just need to get a camera and practice a little bit so I can learn, right?  Do you have suggestions on a good camera to get?",

I do like pizza, and one of my favourite toppings is pineapple. What do you think of pineapple on pizza? I know a lot of people think it's awful!",
            "speaker1: I actually love pineapple on pizza, something unique about the sweet flavor in combination with the cheese oils just hits the spot.  The consistency of it is not to thick or firm so it's not overbearing against the texture of the bread and cheese which are quite soft.  Not to overpowering on flavor which is why like strawberry makes no sense, but pineapple is perfect.",
            "speaker2: Wow, I couldn't have put it better myself! I'm glad I've found another pineapple-pizza fan; we seem to be in a minority here, friend. Did your parents come with you to New York?",

            "speaker1: Yes, it definitely does have some interesting stuff. I do read the bible to my cats. They seem to enjoy the New Testament a little more than Old Testament, I think they like the lighter content, haha! Do you read with your mom?",
            "speaker2: I do. She reminds me that if I displease him, God will kill me with bears, like the Bible says in 2nd Kings,2:24 . He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the LORD. Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the boys. It'",

            "speaker1: Well, there are some office jobs that you wouldn't need a degree for, probably some sales jobs. Maybe you could get a book sales job. You could focus your interview on your love of reading and show them that you are passionate and knowledgeable.",

            "speaker2: Yeah I had to move out and now I'm living in a motel with no windows :( When I was at the rooftop of my house waiting for the rescue team to get me, I actually saw a couple of sharks swimming around in my backyard it was crazy!!!",

            "speaker2: I did too! But I've only seen it alone in the past. This time I saw at least 3-4, their shark fins keep popping up from time to time. I was worried that I might get eaten if the water keeps rising. I'm just glad I'm alive. Have you ever seen anything crazy like this before?1",

            "speaker2: Can't believe you tailed it! The bear just ran away? Yeah it's still pretty bad so we're just going to stay here for a couple of days. Or maybe I can visit you in Atlanta? It's not too far of a drive. I wonder if my insurance cover natural disasters",
            "speaker1: I'm so sorry you have to deal with that fall out. Free remodel at least right? Sorry - trying to look on the bright side. We'd love to have you here!!",
            "speaker2: Thanks!! Do you have a place for me to stay? Or I guess I can sleep on your lawn. Yes, definitely thinking on the bright side, glad I'm still alive, plus instead of a remodel, now I have the excuse of traveling around the world since I don't have a home to go to!!! Plus this is once is a lifetime experience to observe sharks in such a close distance. Everything happens for a reason.",

            "speaker2: No, I've never been stung, but I have seen people get stung!  It looks really painful.  How old are your kids?",

            "speaker1: Hey that's awesome.  After you record are you going to turn it into a youtube video?  That's the best way to get a recording deal.  I love would love to sing with you but the thought of videos and I get stage fright.",

            "speaker1: Well, there's apart from my guitar (obviously), I do enjoy watching movies like you. Although I've never seen Last of the Mohicans, maybe I should add that to my to-watch list?",
            "speaker2: Yes, you should. What is the last movie you watch?",
            "speaker1: I watched Jojo Rabbit last night have you seen it? It's very good.",
            "speaker2: No, I didn't. Do you recommend me watching it? I am planning to watch today The White Tiger.",
            "speaker1: Oh yes, you should definitely watch it, although it might be a little different from your usual movies, it's more of a dark comedy. Were you allowed to watch many movies growing up?",
            "speaker2: Not really. I am father was very strict. What about you?",
            "speaker1: I was allowed to watch them, not that I had much spare time with all of my experiments!",
            "speaker2: I understand. We should go together watch a movie one day. What do you think?",
            "speaker1: I accidentally did something wrong with my science experiment, and burnt the garage down",
            "speaker2: What! That's terrible! You must of lost quite a bit of equipment?",
            "speaker1: Yes I know I'm so mad at myself and it was such a stupid mistake I made, it should have never happened.  Now I have to get everything rebuilt and buy more stuff.  At least insurance is covering a lot of it.",
            "speaker2: I am surprised insurance is covering it, you are lucky. I bet your mom wishes she could ground you again haha",
            "speaker1: I know, I was worried they wouldn't either.  They aren't covering all of mine science equipment but at least they are covering the building.  Haha yes she was so upset when I told her what happened, but I think she was glad it wasn't her garage.",
            "speaker2: Sorry to hear that, it's going to take you a while to rebuild your set up. Was your car in the garage at the time?",
            "speaker1: No I'm very lucky it was parked in the driveway.  I have been parking it out there for the last few months to make room for my science stuff.",
            "speaker2: Good thing, that would have made it even worse. I bet you are still rattled, don't worry I can help you rebuild the garage. I also have a friend that is quite the handyman that would be more than willing to help out for a free pizza lunch :)",
            "speaker1: That would be awesome!  Thank you so much for offering.  Yes I would definitely order some pizzas in.  Have you been to the new pizza joint out on Main St yet?  I heard it was great!",
            "speaker2: I haven't, but I have heard great things about it. Someone told me their 4 cheese pizza was out of this world. Gee, now I am getting hungry! Do they deliver?",
            "speaker1: I think when you and your friend come and help me rebuild I will get some from there then!  I'll definitely make sure the get the 4 cheese too.  Yes they do deliver.  Now that we are talking about it I might have to get some for tonight!",
            "speaker2: I was thinking the same thing. My parents really didn't go much take out growing up, and now I have a real taste for it. My mother would be mortified, but pizza is soooo good.",
            "speaker1: What is your favorite type of pizza?",
            "speaker2: I'm a weirdo. I like anchovies. Lots of 'em. LOL. What do you like on your pizza?",
            "speaker1: Haha, that's too wild for me! I usually keep it simple with pepperoni and mushrooms. I mostly get crazy with the spices. Extra garlic, crushed peppers, more oregano. What can I say, I'm Italian! It's what I was raised on. Since your parents didn't get much takeout, what'd often eat as a kid?",
            "speaker2: Mom did most of the cooking, though dad was better at it. A lot of basic foods, simply prepared. Pretty healthy, but not much variety or flavor.",
            "speaker1: Oh, I see. Well, I had weight issues a lot growing up, so I kinda wish I'd had more healthy stuff. I think what we learn as a kid can help us, though the teaching of it can sometimes hurt us. I know your folks were strict, but you know how to take care of things better than I can. It's a pain in the butt having to try and fix up that garage.",
            "speaker2: Discipline has its advantages in life, but it makes life unfun as a kid. Pizza is my revenge for not getting junk food then. LOL. I'm pretty handy, so I can help with the garage rebuilding.",
            "speaker1: Hahaha, hey, you help me with that, and I'll buy you pizza every month for a year! It's that darn science project I've been working on that burnt it down in the first place. It's really making me wonder if it's worth it to try to pick it back up.  I guess I'll have to learn from you about that. Think you can get that handyman you know to help out?",
            "speaker2: Science project? Is it a time machine? You could go back before the garage burned down. Seriously though, the handyman doesn't really help with rebuilding so much as fixing, but I could ask him if he's interested.",
            "speaker1: Hahaha, I wish! I've been working with different motors, but one of them basically blew up on me, and the fire went to some other chemicals I've got laying around. Thanks for that! Enough about workstuff though, we should have a movie night sometime. You need to catch up on your pizza-eating, and your moviewatching! That'll help your inner child.",
            "speaker2: We could have a double feature. Last of the Mohicans and White Tiger. Then we could know about each other's favorites.",
            "speaker1: Oh, that'd be a great idea! Mohicans was something I've always wanted to see. Jojo Rabbit might also be a good one, if you're in the mood for a laugh!",

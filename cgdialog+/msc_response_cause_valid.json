            "speaker1: I just took the time to try to relax a bit. I've been pretty busy at work the past few days and really needed a bit of a break. The kids really liked seeing the ducks at the park, but I have to always warn them not to touch them.",
            "speaker2: Haha! No doubt! Those ducks can be quite territorial at times! I once walked by a mother and completely missed that she was protecting her new ducklings.. lets just say my shin was a little sore after that encounter.",
            "speaker1: Yes, they seem to want to pet the ducks, but then the ducks end up chasing them and they get scared and run away. It ends up becoming like a game to them, but I'm trying to teach them to respect the ducks too.",

            "speaker2: Season 1 was really good, I was waiting for this one to come out! It's been intense so far, but sometimes it's hard to keep up with the subtitles. You can't be tired to watch this one!",

            "speaker2: I do! its such a fun way to explore and get the kids to burn off energy. what sorts of winter sports do you do?",
            "speaker1: I completely agree! I've been so busy lately I haven't been playing, but usually I play indoor soccer in winter. The kids have just gotten into fencing actually, which has been interesting. How about you guys?",
            "speaker2: I used to fence as a kid! it was great for core strength. i've never tried an indoor sport like soccer but maybe I should for this winter when things get too cold for biking and parks and whatnot. might be a good way to make new friends in a new town!",

            "speaker1: Haha I thought that might be the case. Mine are completely the same. Last time we moved we just had to ship them off to their grandparents to get them out of hair. My daughter is 5 and my son is 8. How about yours?",

            "speaker2: Thank you for that. I'm sure I can figure something out. It is a little out of my wheel house, but I am sure I can do it. Just send me all the details and maybe an idea of what you are looking for.",

Matching one image to a duplicate for example is something this game would do. Landscapes would be a perfect one for imagery and heightening senses for these patients. Finding objects within a painting, and so on.",

I thought it was a neat idea, and started noticing all the empties on the side of the road and on benches and everywhere else, and thought that it could be a fun way to raise some money, or for my son to raise money and be active.  Sort of a treasure hunt, and one that cleans up town in the process.",

There's nothing more disgusting than a half-empty beer can that's been sitting in a ditch for a year, but when your son sees that that's worth money and can be reused, it might encourage their perspective on reusing and recycling things in general.",

Have you found that it affects your energy levels at all? Or, atleast, did it initially?",

I hardly ever learn new recipes or try new foods. So, in some way, I believe my lack of interest is as a result of my childhood. What caused you to become vegan?",

            "speaker1: How are you doing on this great day?.",
            "speaker2: Hi, there! I'm very well, and you? Do you live in the us as well?",
            "speaker1: Yes, but I really enjoy travelling. What do you do?.",
            "speaker2: I'm working in public services, so for the government. Do you have a favourite travel destination?",
            "speaker1: Anywhere abroad, especially europe. I blog about where I travel..",
            "speaker2: Interesting. Do you have a pet?",
            "speaker1: Yes. I have many animals. I was once a veterinarian. How about you?.",
            "speaker2: I've got a pet lizard, lizzy! What do you do for fun?",
            "speaker1: I cook and take care of my animals. Make my living by singing..",
            "speaker2: Ex vet singing, that's varied! In theatres or in bars?",
            "speaker1: Mostly theaters. What are your hobbies?.",
            "speaker2: I enjoy skydiving, it's great fun.",
            "speaker1: Do you have a special diet? I like to eat vegan..",
            "speaker2: No, I'm an omnivore. Do you have a favourite place to hang out?",
            "speaker1: I found the greatest vegan chicken product the other day! Have you ever heard of plant-based meats?",
            "speaker2: I have heard of them, but I do not know much about them if I am totally honest. What did you cook with it?",
            "speaker1: You can bread them up and fry them as chicken nuggets. They also go well with a saucy pasta, or in a curry. The possibilities are endless! Would you be interested in trying them out, or do you think you'll stick with regular chicken?",
            "speaker2: I will probably just stick with regular chicken, but I do need to make some changes with my diet in order to beenfit the environment. Could you tell the difference in taste between the plant-based chicken and normal chicken?",
            "speaker1: Plant-based chicken is less stringy, and a bit different in texture. Some brands taste more like tofu than real chicken. I'd say chicken nuggets are a gentle introduction to plant-based foods, though. You can't really tell the difference, since it's all ground up anyways.",
            "speaker2: Oh, I really didn't know that. Maybe, after your explanation, I will give plant-based meats a try after all. I don't know, I just feel like they won't give the same amount of energy as normal meats do. I am so active on a daily basis that I don't want to be feeling tired as a result of my dietary choices. Have you found that it affects your energy levels at all? Or, atleast, did it initially?",
            "speaker1: A little bit. I drink more fresh-squeezed fruit juice and protein shakes to compensate. I also make sure to eat a greater variety of plants, so that I can get all the nutrients I need.",
            "speaker2: You seem to be very well-versed in these types of things. I really should listen to you more, I guess I am just set in my ways with a lot of things. Food being one of them. When you were younger, did you parents teach you how to cook?",
            "speaker1: I did learn to cook when I was younger, but I didn't become a vegan until later. I guess those cooking skills are very much transferrable, though.",
            "speaker2: You see, when I was younger, I never really got involved with the cooking in my house and I believe that is probably the reason why I don't experiment much with my foods. I hardly ever learn new recipes or try new foods. So, in some way, I believe my lack of interest is as a result of my childhood. What caused you to become vegan?",
            "speaker1: I forgot to ask, what are your favorite places to skydive?",
            "speaker2: Florida is a great place, as they have so many airports!",
            "speaker1: It must be thrilling!  Sometimes when I get on stage to sing, it feels like I've just jumped out of an airplane!",
            "speaker2: Haha that's a great analogy! The scariest thing about skydiving is wondering whether or not the chute will open!",
            "speaker1: The scariest thing about being on stage is wondering if a tomato will knock you into the orchestra pit!  But at least if your chute fails no one will right bad reviews about your performance! haha",
            "speaker2: Haha I suppose I'd still end up in the papers, but I wouldn't be around to read them! What's the scariest performance experience you've had?",
            "speaker1: It was probably at the Hollywood Bowl.  So many people watching.  And because of the acoustics there wasn't even a microphone to hide behind. I felt naked!",
            "speaker2: Whoa you performed there? That's an amazing achievement! I once saw the LA Phil play there. I can only imagine how scary that was!",
            "speaker1: Yes, but it was the greatest high ever when the performance was over.  It's probably a lot like how you feel after you've finished a dive, I bet!",
            "speaker2: Yes, it's a huge rush! Did you perform with a pianist or with a full orchestra?",
            "speaker1: It was with a full orchestra. So at least I wasn't up there all alone.",
            "speaker2: Wow, I'd love to hear you sing with an orchestra. Did they record the performance?",
            "speaker1: I found a new vegan recipe that I think you might like. Can I share it with you?",
            "speaker2: Sure!  As long as there's no tofu in it! I hate tofu!",
            "speaker1: Ha ha; you can probably substitute black beans for the tofu then. Great source of protein! Important for you since you're so active.",
            "speaker2: Right.  I had a great idea though for a new business.  Meat-based plants!  Now that's a vegan diet I could get behind!   I still feel the need for that complete protein.",
            "speaker1: Yeah, it can definitely be a tough transition. Perhaps just start experimenting with simpler aspects of a recipe.",
            "speaker2: Maybe I can just ease away from animal protein slowly.",
            "speaker1: Yeah, exactly. Black beans, peas, etc. I don't know how you feel about carbs. Cooking is definitely one of those things that you have to do regularly to build confidence. What kind of activity do you do?",
            "speaker2: Well, whenever I'm going to skydive, I run to the airfield and back.  That's about 10 miles each way.",
            "speaker1: Oh, wow. I guess the flight gives you time to catch your breath. How many jumps have you done?",
            "speaker2: 38 so far. Have you been performing much lately?",
            "speaker1: Not since the last time, but I'm waiting for my agent to get back to me on some prospective gigs. Maybe I'll get one with the LA Phil and you can see me!",

            "speaker1: Good idea. I'd try going just the two of you though. Make her see that your'e not going to hurt her child. Maybe see if she wants to go fishing with you? Longer trip, but maybe spending the day together will get her to relax. Who knows, you might become good friends.",

            "speaker2: Exactly and I'm deeply in love, but all she can bring up is the divorce. I've talked about that extensively with my fianc\u00e9 and we are solid. I don't get why her mother can't just accept us",

            "speaker1: Your rabbits so cute! Have you tried playing music for rabbits? My dog loves it when I play relaxing music for dogs.",
            "speaker2: I haven't intentionally tried to play music for him, but maybe I'll give it a try! Aww! That's so sweet What does your dog like the most?",
            "speaker1: I usually find a random playlist on youtube and search music for dogs haha! I think he looks the most peaceful when it's soft classical music.",
            "speaker2: That's precious! Does he enjoy your clarinet playing?",

            "speaker1: Oh that's so gross!  But cool about having a cat/dog!  I've actually looked into getting a skunk.  I've been told they are a lot like cats, but they are more sociable, like dogs.",

            "speaker1: Hahaha, yeah, definitely have the glands removed first.  I need to do more research first though.  Are there places close to you that you could get a serval?  Do they have rescues for those or would you have to buy from a breeder?",
            "speaker2: There is a exotic pet breeder nearby. It's a process thought to even get approved. I'm not sure I would get approved now that I'm reading this. They have someone come to my home and inspect first.",

            "speaker2: I guess size matters with servals... My place is pretty small. I think I'll have to get a letter from my landlord too.",
            "speaker1: Too bad.  I'm not sure if they like to be outside, but do you have a yard for them?  Sometimes even if you have a small place, a big yard can make up for it.  That's how it is for me.  My house isn't the biggest, but my dog has tons of room to run outside.",
            "speaker2: True. I don't have a yard though. I would have to walk it would a harness and leash. I've seen that done with servals though, and I don't mind several walks a day.",

            "speaker2: We stopped by the cafeteria at the end and got some free Dr. Pepper, yes.  Or at least I think it was supposed to be free.  I drank it and didn't pay for it either way.  I felt it would be criminal to not get some Dr. Pepper at the museum.",

That way if you don't like it, you can drive back home, hahaha.  But if it's not a problem, then you could save some money on airfare.  That's my favorite part about teleporting, it's very cost effective.",

            "speaker1: They are just about to enter their teenage years (11 and 12).  I'm hoping that they continue to love Disney as much as I do. I would love to see something from the Lion King on Ice.  I saw it on Broadway with both my kids and they were in love.  The costumes were fabulous.",

            "speaker1: Oh yes, I will hike near my school because it's so lovely landscaped, naturally and enhanced, around there. I've even tried to hike in the winter, but I can't seem to do it in colder weather. Since you love winter, do you ever hike during that time?",
            "speaker2: Wow it must be a great campus to go to everyday! I can hike during the winter as long as the weather is not too extreme. Have you looked up any places to go hiking in Spain?",
            "speaker1: Oh, I am always surfing online about Spain and soak up what I can about it since I will definitely be going in a year. I know I will miss going to see the Bills while I'm there though. Do you ever go to their games?",
            "speaker2: You should let me know if you ever find anything interesting during your online research! I try to see the Bills in person whenever I can get tickets but I mostly go to pubs with some friends and watch there. Do you get to go?",
            "speaker1: Yes, they're my favorite team so I make sure I find a way to go to a few games each year. But, I don't think they will be willing to travel to Spain for me to play!",

            "speaker2: Oh wow! Like a street view type thing? Have you looked at where you're going in Spain?",
            "speaker1: Yes, exactly like that but with more details than Google's version. I am still not sure but for now, I prefer Barcelona",
            "speaker2: That sounds incredible! I will have a look too - maybe I can get some leave to come visit when you're out there? I'll definitely go for the cooler months of the year for sure!",

            "speaker2: Ah, the conflict of loving the cold but wanting to visit Spain. Hopefully I can tolerate it for a week or two, I mean... the pina coladas would be such a hardship! Hopefully there's some good hiking for you around there?",
            "speaker1: You will love it anyway, trust me, it is a perfect getaway from cold weather. Barcelona is surrounded with hills and mountains so there's a plenty of hiking activities to choose from",
